# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. In this project, we have built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. (Comments in this project are for educational purposes only.)
